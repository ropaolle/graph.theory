## Graph theory - From a computer science point of view

- Vertices (nodes) and Edges: `V = {v1, v2, v3}`, `E = {v1v2, v1v3, v2v3}`
  - Undirected: `E = { {a,b}, {b,c} }`
  - Directed: `E = { (a,b), (b,c) }`
- Adjacent: Two vertices are said to be adjacent if they are connected by an edge.
- Order: The number of vertices in the graph.
- Size: Number of edges in the graph.
- Empty graph: Graph with no edges `G = (V, {})`.
- Trivial graph: Only one vertex, no edges.
- Null graph: No vertices and no deges: `G = ({}, {})`
- Simple graph: Undirected, only one edge between the same vertices, no selfterminating edges.
- Euler stuff
  - Euler circuit: Visit all edges once and sam start and end vertex (all vertices must be of even degree).
  - Euler path: Visit all edges once (must have 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree).
  - Eulerization: Adding edges until we get even degrees.
- Hamiltonian path: Visit all vertices once.
- Hamiltonian circuit: Visit all vertices once and return to the start vertex.

### Basics

[Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQA-m22wjTQ&list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDGO4--qE8yH72HFL1Km93P&index=2)

- Types (most common)
  - Undirected, directed, weighted graphs
  - Trees, rooted trees (in-tree, out-tree)
  - Directed asyclic graphs (DAGs)
  - Bipartite graph
  - Complete graph
- Representing graps
  - Adjacency matrix
  - Adjacency list: `A -> [(B,4), (C,1), ...]`
  - Edge list: `[(C,A,4), (A,C,2), ...]`
